This year we build a new Drive appliction for you. I think its better than last year's.

**Note:**

* Session folders will be deleted every 10 minutes
* You will be getting flag in the following format `[0-9a-f]{9}`. Submit that in the flag format such as if you get `deadbeeff`, submit as `bi0sctf{deadbeeff}`
